# DIY audio amplifier, Episode 1

Video URL: <https://youtu.be/zHN0I3KboBo>

In this episode we build a split-rail power supply for powering the
LM1875 amplifier modules.

The [PowerSupply](PowerSupply) directory has the schematic for the
circuit used in the power supply board shown in the video, minus
the screw terminals used for inputs and outputs.

As I said in the video, **circuits using mains voltage are dangerous**
and you should be extremely careful if you decide to build this circuit,
or something similar.
